<p><hw>A</hw> (<i>named &amacr; in the English, and most commonly &auml; in
other languages</i>). <def>The first letter of the English and of many
other alphabets. The capital A of the alphabets of Middle and Western
Europe, as also the small letter (a), besides the forms in Italic, black
letter, etc., are all descended from the old Latin A, which was borrowed
from the Greek <i>Alpha</i>, of the same form; and this was made from the
first letter (&?;) of the Ph&oelig;nician alphabet, the equivalent of the
Hebrew <i>Aleph</i>, and itself from the Egyptian origin. The <i>Aleph</i>
was a consonant letter, with a guttural breath sound that was not an
element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks took it to represent their
vowel <i>Alpha</i> with the &auml; sound, the Ph&oelig;nician alphabet
having no vowel symbols.</def></p>

<p>This letter, in English, is used for several different vowel sounds. See
<i>Guide to pronunciation</i>, &sect;&sect; 43-74. The regular long
<i>a</i>, as in <i>fate</i>, etc., is a comparatively modern sound, and has
taken the place of what, till about the early part of the 17th century, was
a sound of the quality of &auml; (as in <i>far</i>).</p>

<p><sn><b>2.</b></sn> <i>(Mus.)</i> <def>The name of the sixth tone in the
model major scale (that in C), or the first tone of the minor scale, which
is named after it the scale in A minor. The second string of the violin is
tuned to the A in the treble staff. -- A sharp (A&sharp;) is the name of a
musical tone intermediate between A and B. -- A flat (A&flat;) is the name
of a tone intermediate between A and G.</def></p>

<p><hw>A-</hw>. <def>A, as a prefix to English words, is derived from
various sources. (1) It frequently signifies <i>on</i> or <i>in</i> (from
<i>an</i>, <i>a</i> forms of AS. <i>on</i>), denoting a state, as in
<i>a</i>foot, on foot, <i>a</i>bed, <i>a</i>miss, <i>a</i>sleep, aground,
<i>a</i>loft, <i>a</i>way (AS. <i>onweg</i>), and analogically,
<i>a</i>blaze, <i>a</i>tremble, etc. (2) AS. <i>of</i> off, from, as in
<i>a</i>down (AS. <i>ofd&umacr;ne</i> off the <i>dun</i> or hill). (3) AS.
&amacr;- (Goth. <i>us-</i>, <i>ur-</i>, Ger. <i>er-</i>), usually giving an
intensive force, and sometimes the sense of <i>away</i>, <i>on</i>,
<i>back</i>, as in <i>a</i>rise, <i>a</i>bide, <i>a</i>go. (4) Old English
<i>y-</i> or <i>i-</i> (corrupted from the AS. inseparable particle <i>ge-
</i>, cognate with OHG. <i>ga-</i>, <i>gi-</i>, Goth. <i>ga-</i>), which,
as a prefix, made no essential addition to the meaning, as in aware. (5)
French <i>&agrave;</i> (L. <i>ad</i> to), as in <i>a</i>base,
<i>a</i>chieve. (6) L. <i>a</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>abs</i>, from, as in
<i>a</i>vert. (7) Greek insep. prefix &alpha; without, or privative, not,
as in <i>a</i>byss, <i>a</i>theist; akin to E. <i>un-</i>.</def></p>
