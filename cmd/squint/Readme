here's the plan 9 source.  you'll need to adjust it somewhat to compile
locally, but the heart of it - the interpreter - should be fairly easy.
you'll almost certainly want to drop libg and liblayer; they're graphics
things (and in fact liblayer doesn't work right now because of changes
in some of the operating systems stuff) that i've included as examples
of how libraries are built.  (that is one thing i am not happy with).
include/* are newsqueak headers; progs/* are test programs.
