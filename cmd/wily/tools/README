	wattach
		Attaches to a window & prints out an ascii version of the
		events to
		        stdout. as in
		
		wattach $query_win | awk '
		        $1 == "exec" {
		                s = $3 for (i = 4; i <= NF; i++){
		                        s = s " " $i
		                } system("rc -c ''do_query " s " ''")
		        }
		'
	wcat
		Print the contents of a Wily window to STDOUT.
		Doesn't handle the last-char-in-msg-aint-ascii problem.
	
	windows
		print out a readable list of windows. used mostly for
			; cat name2id #!/bin/sh
	        windows | awk '$1 == "'$1'" {print $2}'
	
	wread
		read contents of a window.
	
	wreplace
		replace the contents of window. unfortunately it still uses a hardcoded range of :,
	
	With just these programs i built a custom interface to our distributed,
	hetrogenious database system. In 170 lines of shell script.

	I will see if I can't work out a way to distribute a toy system.

	Having to know window id's is pretty cumbersome, I know,
	and I'm open to suggestions on how to improve things.
	
	Wins
		print list of 'filename winid' lines to stdout
	Wexec cmd id
		Execute cmd (as if selected with b2), in context of id
	Wgoto path id
		Goto 'path' (as if selected with b3), in context of id
