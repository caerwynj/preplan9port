<DL><DD><H4>ABSTRACT</H4>
A tutorial for 
<TT>tea</TT>,
a tool for managing time varying data.
<TT>Tea</TT>
annotates the file
name space with attributes and links files
in binary relations.
</DL>
<H4>Tutorial
</H4>
<P>
Begin by setting the TDB environment variable to a directory
where your attribute files will be stored.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% TDB=/usr/glenda/tea
</PRE></TT></DL>
<TT>9ls</TT>
is a slight modification on 
<TT>ls</TT>(1).
The default output format prints
a triad of time, element, and attribute, where time is the file's
modification time in seconds since the epoch, element is the absolute
filename and attribute is file size in bytes.  With the -e flag it
prints the current clock time instead of modification time.  The time
value becomes the effective valid time for queries using tea.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls /bin/tdbjoin
1058049198	/bin/tdbjoin	
</PRE></TT></DL>
Say we want to add a description of this file to the tea database
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls /bin/tdbjoin |tea 'desc="temporal database join"'
1058049198	/bin/tdbjoin	temporal database join
</PRE></TT></DL>
<TT>Desc</TT>
is the name we chose for the new attribute and we assigned the
string to the attribute with  time and element taken from standard input.
</P>
<P>
To view the descriptions of all files in /bin
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls /bin |tea desc
1058049198	/bin/tdbjoin	temporal database join
</PRE></TT></DL>
We have only added one description so we only get one record.  The
output from tea is a triad with the named attribute substituting the
input attribute.
</P>
<P>
Lets change the description slightly making a new description valid
at the current time
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls -e /bin/tdbjoin |tea 'desc="join primitive used by tea"'
1058062608	/bin/tdbjoin	join primitive used by tea
</PRE></TT></DL>
What do we get when we query the 'desc' attribute?
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls /bin/tdbjoin |tea desc
1058049198	/bin/tdbjoin	temporal database join
</PRE></TT></DL>
The effective valid time (EVT) for the query is still the modification
time of the file.  Add the -e flag to get the current 
<TT>desc</TT>
value.
Or 
<TT>touch</TT>(1)
the file before running the query again.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls -e /bin/tdbjoin |tea desc
1058062608	/bin/tdbjoin	join primitive used by tea
</PRE></TT></DL>
</P>
<P>
The attributes are stored in
files below the directory pointed to by
<TT>TDB</TT>.
New files are created as new
attributes are named and values assigned to them.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% ls <I>TDB
/usr/glenda/tea/desc
</I></PRE></TT></DL>
We now want to see all descriptions created for the file, not just
the currently effective 'desc'.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls /bin/tdbjoin |tea desc+
1058049198	/bin/tdbjoin	temporal database join
1058049198	/bin/tdbjoin	join primitive used by tea
</PRE></TT></DL>
The '+' suffix implies one of more entries. Some more
suffixes that alter the join with the attributes are listed below:
<br><img src="tut.2630.gif"><br>
The query prints the effective attribute value using the effective
valid time of the elements selected by 
<TT>9ls</TT>.
In the examples above 
the EVT was the modification time of 
<TT>/bin/tdbjoin</TT>.
</P>
<P>
Let us view the valid times of the attribute values, that is, the valid
times that were assigned when they were inserted.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls /bin/tdbjoin |tea desc+%
1058049198	/bin/tdbjoin	temporal database join
1058062524	/bin/tdbjoin	join primitive used by tea
</PRE></TT></DL>
The '%' suffix says we want the effective valid time of the attribute
value.  Let us delete that last entry to make the original the
effective value again.  Think of the database as append only.  We will
add another record to the database with the same time, element, and
attribute value as the last entry.  This toggles the existence of that
entry.  This 'delete' entry will have it's own transaction time, so by
changing our effective transaction time (ETT) we can go back in
history to view the attributes before we deleted them.  The default
effective transaction time is the current time.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls -e /bin/tdbjoin |tea 'desc% desc=_'
1058062524	/bin/tdbjoin	join primitive used by tea
% 9ls  /bin/tdbjoin |tea desc+
1058049198	/bin/tdbjoin	temporal database join
</PRE></TT></DL>
The underscore '_' in the assignment statement means assign the standard input
to the named attribute, and the input in this case is the valid time, element
and attribute of the currently effective 
<TT>desc</TT>
attribute.
</P>
<P>
Say we want to go back in history before deleting that last entry. Just
set the 
<TT>ETT</TT>
environment variable to a time prior to the deletion. Unset
the 
<TT>ETT</TT>
to return to the present.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% ETT=1058062520
% 9ls -e /bin/tdbjoin |tea desc+
1058049198	/bin/tdbjoin	temporal database join
1058062524	/bin/tdbjoin	join primitive used by tea
% ETT=()
</PRE></TT></DL>
</P>
<P>
Let us create a relation between a binary file and it's source directory
and let us create descriptions for both files and assign an author.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls -e /bin/acme |tea 'src="/sys/src/cmd/acme"'
1058063753	/bin/acme	/sys/src/cmd/acme

% 9ls -de /sys/src/cmd/acme /bin/acme |\
tea 'desc="interactive text windows"'
1058064170	/bin/acme	interactive text windows
1058064170	/sys/src/cmd/acme	interactive text windows

% 9ls -de /sys/src/cmd/acme |tea 'author="rob pike"'
1058064216	/sys/src/cmd/acme	rob pike
</PRE></TT></DL>
The assignments to 
<TT>desc</TT>
and
<TT>author</TT>
could have been combined to form the command,
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
tea 'desc="interactive text windows" author="rob pike"'.
</PRE></TT></DL>
</P>
<P>
We can now query on 
<TT>/bin/acme</TT>
and find it's source and author.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls -e /bin/acme |tea 'src. author'
1058064442	/sys/src/cmd/acme	rob pike
</PRE></TT></DL>
The '.'  dot suffix to the 
<TT>src</TT>
attribute is used to substitute the
attribute value in place of the element value in the output.  We then
further join with the 
<TT>author</TT>
attribute, which because it has no suffix
performs the default action of changing the input attribute value to
the effective value of the named attribute on output.
</P>
<P>
This combination of attributes in the tea command line can be thought
of as a pipeline (which is in fact how it is implemented by tea).  An
attribute and any suffixes filter the input for the next attribute in
the line.  Each attribute in the line only acts on the triad, the
first three values separated by tabs in the input.
</P>
<P>
To list the values of more than one attribute place a comma between
attribute names.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls -e /bin/acme |tea 'src, desc, author'
</PRE></TT></DL>
</P>
<H4>The Valid Time Line
</H4>
<P>
The effective valid time (EVT) is the first value in the triad.  When
data is assigned to an attribute the EVT is used to set the start time
for the attribute: the time when it becomes valid.  (Internally there
is also a transaction time which cannot be controlled by the user.)
</P>
<P>
What then is the end time?
</P>
<P>
The end time depends on the interpretation of an attribute, and this
interpretation is set by the suffix flags we append to the attribute
name in our tea query.
</P>
<P>
In one of our examples above the second assignment to desc for the
<TT>/bin/tdbjoin</TT>
element meant the new value became the effective value.
This is the default interpretation: The new value's start time becomes
the end time for the last attibute of the same element.  This implies
a one-to-one relationship between element and attribute values.
</P>
<P>
A one-to-many can also be implemented by using '+' and '*' flags.  But
say we want to explicitly set the end time for an element attribute
pair.  This is done by inserting the same element and attribute values
twice but with different valid times.  The earlier time is the start
and the later time is the end.  The validity of the element attribute
pair is toggled along the valid time line with each new instance of
the pair.  Use the '^' symbol as the flag to support the toggle of the
valid time line.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% 9ls /club |tea 'members^'
</PRE></TT></DL>
</P>
<P>
We can also query the valid time line without listing the elements
first using 9ls.  For example, say we want to see all elements in the
<TT>desc</TT>
attribute that were assigned today.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
% tea desc:
</PRE></TT></DL>
The ':' colon suffix begins a range query. A range is similar to
an address within ed or sam. In place of line numbers we have
dates in yyyymmdd format where yyyy and mm and dd are optional and
default to the current year and month and day. Here are some examples
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
# All elements in desc
% tea desc:,
# All elements in the January of the current year
% tea desc:0101,0201
# Elements on the 1st of the current month
% tea desc:1
# Elements in 2002
% tea desc:20020101,20030101
</PRE></TT></DL>
A range query is a select operation and replaces the 9ls and begins
at the front of a tea query. 

</P>
<H4>Implementation
</H4>
<P>
The attribute files are Btrees.  A file contains a header block and a
sequence of data blocks each containing an array of entries.  The
entries are variable length and each block has a rudimentary form of
compression, whereby contiguous like keys and values are collapsed.
Each entry is stored in 3 inversions with each inversion sorted on
time, element, and attribute, respectively.

My own contribution is the application of the Time Element Attribute
triad, the standard join condition for the temporal joins, and the
concepts for the Valid Time line.
