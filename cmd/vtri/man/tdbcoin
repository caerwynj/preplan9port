.TH TDBCOIN 1
.SH NAME
tdbcoin - coincident join, temporal database operator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tdbcoin
[
.I -123d
]
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tdbcoin
reads triads from standard input of the same format as
.IR tdbjoin (1),
and performs a coincident join between the input triad 
and the temporal relation 
stored in
.I file 
created by
.IR tdbadd (1).
.PP
A coincident join finds the nearest neighbor,
either before or after, of the triad along the valid time line.
.PP
The following options are recognized.
.TP
.BI - n
where 
.I n
is inversion 1, 2, or 3 of the triad
to use to find the coincident entry. 
1st inversion, the default, uses only the
effective valid time of the triad to locate
an entry in the file. 
2nd inversion restricts the valid time line to
entries matching the element of the triad,
and then uses the effective valid time to locate the
nearest neighbor.
3rd inversion is the same as 2nd but
uses the attribute of the triad to restrict
the valid time line.
.TP
.B -d
Print the entry following the triad along the valid
time line. The default is to print the preceding entry.
.SH EXAMPLES
If 
.I task
is a temporal relation containing a log of personal activity,
the following prints what tasks you were working 
on when files in 
.L /bin
were last modified.
