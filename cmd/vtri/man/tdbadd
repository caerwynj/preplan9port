.SH NAME
tdbadd - insert records into a temporal relation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tdbadd
[
.I -123p
]
.I file
[
.I attribute
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tdbadd
inserts records read from standard input
into the temporal relation stored in
.IR file .
.PP
If
.I file
does not exist it will be created.
.PP
The temporal relation in
.I file
is a Btree with each entry containing the fields
transaction time, valid time, element, and attribute.
.PP
Input fields are separated by tabs, and records
are separated by lines. The input fields are the
same as those for the temporal relation, but
with transaction time, valid time and attribute optional.
Transaction time and valid time default to the current time
if they are not read from input.
.PP
The possible combination of inputs are the following:
.TP
1 field
element
.TP
2 fields
element attribute
.TP
3 fields
valid-time element attribute
.TP
4 fields
transaction-time valid-time element attribute
.PP
If an
.I attribute
value is supplied on the command line, it is used in place of any attribute
value from standard input.
.PP
There are three possible inversions in which to store
the entry. The entry is added to each inversion specified
as an option.
.PP
The
.I -p
option prints the records that are inserted to standard output,
so the command can appear in the middle of a pipeline.
.PP
Each entry in a relation should be unique on the four fields,
though this is not enforced. To 
.I delete
an entry
add another entry with identical valid-time, element, and attributes
values. The validity of time, element, and attribute triads
is toggled along the transaction time line.
