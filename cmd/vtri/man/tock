.TH TOCK 1
.SH NAME
tock - sum values of temporal triads
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tock
[
.I -rp
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tock
sums values of temporal triads having the same key, read
from standard input. This has the effect of
collapsing the set of triads printing out a unique set of keys
with the sum of their respective values. The effective date
of the unique triad is the latest date for that key.
.PP
The option
.I -r
works on keys that form pathnames. The values from all
child pathnames are added to the parent, so the value
of the root, 
.IR / ,
will be the sum of all triad values.
.PP
The option 
.I -p
works similar to 
.I -r
processing pathnames, but instead prints
the proportion each child is of the parents total.
