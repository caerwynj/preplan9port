tdbcoin - coinicidence join, temporal database operator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tdbjoin
[
.I -123d
]
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tdbcoin
reads from standard input lines specifying a set of temporal
triads,
and joins each triad with the temporal relation 
stored in
.I file 
created by
.IR tdbadd (1).
.PP
The fields of the input triad are
.BR time , 
.BR element , 
and
.B attribute
separated by tabs.
Any other data on the input line are passed through.
.PP
The temporal relation also is a set of triads.
The time of the input triad is the effective time. 
The time of the
temporal relation is the valid time, that is, 
the start time when
the element attribute pair become valid.
The standard join condition is true when both element fields match
and the valid time is less than the effective time and effective
time is less than the next greater valid time for the element, 
or if no greater valid time
for the element exists.
The join condition can be altered by one of the command line flags. 
.PP
The default output 
is a  triad with time being the effective time
taken from the input and element and attribute
values taken from the 
.IR file .
.PP
The following options are recognized.
.TP
.BI - n
where 
.I n
is the inversion 1, 2, or 3 on which to join. 
1st inversion implies the element
is a time in seconds and the 
.I file 
is searched on the time field. 
2nd inversion, the default, searches the
.I file
on the element field. 
3rd inversion searches 
.I file
on the attribute field.
.TP
.B -m
The relation is one-to-many so the valid time is ignored in the
relation and all matching records are printed.
.TP
.B -o
Outer join. The source (standard input) line is printed even if no matching
target line is found.
.TP
.B -p
Treat the element as a prefix to be searched on, instead of the default
which is an exact match of the key.
.TP
.B -r
Interpret the input element and attribute as a range and print
all triads from 
.I file
that fall within that range.
.TP
.B -v
Print the valid time instead of the effective time.
.TP
.B -t
Toggle the validity of the element/attribute pair on every successive entry along
the valid time line. This is also a one-to-many join
where effective time specifies the cut-off date for the join; 
no tuples specified in the future are considered.

directory.
